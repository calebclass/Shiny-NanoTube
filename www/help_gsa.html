  <p>Gene set enrichment analysis is conducted using the 'fgsea' preranked package,
  resulting in a table of statistics and a heatmap of gene expression within specified
  gene sets.</p>
  
  <h2>Options</h2>
  <p><b>Comparison</b>: The group that will be compared against the base group.</p>
  <p><b>Clustering Threshold</b>: Gene sets containing similar genes are clustered together to ease the 
  interpretation of results. The overlap between two gene sets is calculated as the Jaccard index,
  the genes overlapping between the sets divided by the union (total genes) of the sets.  Sets with an overlap
  greater than the clustering threshold will be "clustered" together. Moving this slider
  to the left will result in more gene sets being clustered together.</p>
  <p><b>q-value Threshold</b>: Only gene sets with a q-value (p-value adjusted for multiple testing) 
  below the threshold will be included in the table or heatmap. Use a threshold of 1 to 
  include all gene sets.</p>
  <p><b>Cluster to plot</b>: The gene set "cluster" to plot in a heatmap. The assigned
  cluster for each gene set can be found in the results table; a cluster may contain
  one or more gene sets.</p>
  
  <h2>Result Table</h2>
  <p>This table contains the standard gene set analysis statistics for each gene set, based on the options
  set by the user. "p.adj" is equivalent
  to a "q-value", and the NES provides the normalized enrichment score, or the direction of the enrichment.
  Gene sets that are more highly expressed in the "Group" will have a positive NES, while those highly expressed
  in "Base Group" will have a negative NES.</p>
  
  <p>Gene sets are clustered using the Jaccard index (as defined above), and the gene set with the lowest p-value
  within each cluster is defined as the "most enriched" gene set of the cluster ("Cluster.Max"). The developers 
  generally recommend that the user focus on the gene set within each cluster with the lowest p-value, as this
  one may be responsible for the detected enrichment of the other gene sets. However, this recommendation is not
  absolute, as multiple similar pathways may be providing unique contributions.</p>
  
  <h2>Heatmap</h2>
  <p>A leading edge heatmap for a "Cluster" of gene sets can be plotted by specifying which cluster in the options.
  Cells are colored based on the log2(expression) for each gene in each sample, centered on the median of the 
  "Base Group". If there are more than one gene set in the cluster, gene set membership information is also
  provided in the heatmap.</p>
