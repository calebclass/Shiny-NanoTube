    <p>NanoTube performs data processing, quality control, normalization
       and analysis on NanoString gene expression data.</p>
    
    <p>Click on the <b>Job Setup</b> tab to get started.</p>
    
    <h2>Basic Features</h2>
    <h3>Data Processing</h3>
    <p>nCounter data are input as raw RCC files or CSV files (which possibly came from the RCC Collector tool). An additional sample information table is then loaded to allow comparisons between groups.</p>
    <h3>Normalization</h3>
    <p>This application performs manufacturer-recommended normalization steps, including positive and housekeeping
    normalization, as well as the removal of target genes found to have expression levels below "background" (estimated
    from the negative control gene expression).</p>
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>nCounter data are input as raw RCC files or CSV files (possibly from the RCC Collector tool), which can then be          combined with a sample information table and saved as an ExpressionSet.</p>
    <h3>Visualization</h3>
    <p>nCounter data are input as raw RCC files or CSV files (possibly from the RCC Collector tool), which can then be          combined with a sample information table and saved as an ExpressionSet.</p>
    
    <p><i>Additional normalization and analysis options are provided in the <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/NanoTube.html">NanoTube package on Bioconductor.</a></i></p>
