  <h2>NanoString data</h2>
  <p>Your NanoString data should be loaded as a ZIP folder containing one 
  RCC file per sample, or a CSV or TXT file containing expression data 
  for all samples.</p>
  
  <h2>Sample info table</h2>
  <p>This field requires a CSV file containing sample information.  This Shiny app conducts
  group-vs.-group comparisons, so one column must include the group identifier for each sample (for example, Treated or Control). 
  Sample names should be in the first column. If the RCC filenames are used as sample
  names, they will be merged so that they match.  Otherwise, the RCC files and sample
  table will be merged in the order they're supplied. The merge can be checked prior to 
  analysis using "Check Samples", to make sure they match.</p>
  
  <h2>Group Column</h2>
  <p>After loading the sample info table, a dropdown box will appear, containing the columns
  from that table (such as the "Treatment" column). Select the column containing the group 
  information for differential expression analysis.</p>
  
  <h2>Base Group</h2>
  <p>This is the group that all other groups will be compared against (i.e. the 
  denominator in your Fold Change). For example, if your data contain groups "A", "B", 
  and "C", and you select "C" as the base group, NanoTube will conduct analyses and 
  calculate fold changes for A vs. C and B vs. C.</p>
  
  <h2>Gene Set Database</h2>
  <p>Required only for Gene Set Analysis feature. Gene set database (gmt format, such as those found at MSigDB)
  can be loaded here. Alternatively, an rds file could also be loaded, containing the gene set database in list form (each member of the list is a vector of genes from one gene set). The REACTOME database is provided as a gmt file in the GitHub "data" folder.</p>

  <h2>Advanced Options</h2>
  <h3>Housekeeping Genes</h3>
  <p>NanoTube will automatically identify housekeeping genes for normalization by selecting
  those marked as "Housekeeping" in the <b>CodeClass</b>. Alternatively, these can be manually
  specified with this option, by inputting a comma-separated list of genes to be used as housekeeping genes.</p>
  
  <h3>Negative Control Threshold</h3>
  <p>The NanoTube app performs a two-sample, one-sided t test for each gene: this test compares the
  expression of that gene across all samples vs. the expression of all negative control genes
  across all samples. The p-value of this test is for the null hypothesis that the endogenous gene does
  not have expression above the negative control genes. In this field, you can specify the signifance
  level required to keep a gene for analysis. A lower value is a more stringent threshold: 
  genes with a p-value above this level will be removed, and not
  included in differential expression or gene set analysis. To skip this step, this value can be set to 2.</p>
  
  <h3>Minimum Gene Set Size</h3>
  <p>In this field, you can set the number of genes required for an individual gene set (from a loaded gmt file)
  to be included in analysis. For example, if this value is set to 5 (default), only gene sets with at least 5 genes present
  in your data set will be included in gene set analysis.</p>
