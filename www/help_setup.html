  <h2>NanoString data</h2>
  <p>Your NanoString data should be loaded as a ZIP folder containing one 
  RCC file per sample, or a CSV or TXT file containing expression data 
  for all samples.</p>
  
  <h2>Sample info table</h2>
  <p>This field requires a CSV file containing sample information.  This Shiny app conducts
  group-vs.-group comparisons, so one column must include the group identifier for each sample (for example, Treated or Control). 
  Sample names should be in the first column. If the RCC filenames are used as sample
  names, they will be merged so that they match.  Otherwise, the RCC files and sample
  table will be merged in the order they're supplied. The merge can be checked prior to 
  analysis using "Check Samples", to make sure they match.</p>
  
  <h3><i>Advanced:</i> Design Matrix Input</h3>
  <p><b>Check this box only if you input a Design Matrix as described here.</b><br>
  For more complex experimental designs (for example, involving multiple factors or 
  numeric factors, this can be overruled by inputting a Model Matrix (or Design Matrix) in this step.  
  This should be input as a csv or txt file (similar to the sample info table), 
  where each row is a sample and each column is a factor. This can be generated
  manually or using R, with the model.matrix() function. For proper functioning in this web app, the first column should be
  the Intercept term (equal to 1 for all samples), and other columns should be 0/1 for group variables (not including 
  control group) or numeric for numeric variables. An example model matrix is provided in the data folder of the 
  Shiny-NanoTube github repository.</p>
  
  <h2>Group Column</h2>
  <p>After loading the sample info table, a dropdown box will appear, containing the columns
  from that table (such as the "Treatment" column). Select the column containing the group 
  information for differential expression analysis.</p>
  
  <p>If the user input a design matrix instead, the "Group Column" and "Base Group" options
  are not shown.</p>
  
  <h2>Base Group</h2>
  <p>This is the group that all other groups will be compared against (i.e. the 
  denominator in your Fold Change). For example, if your data contain groups "A", "B", 
  and "C", and you select "C" as the base group, NanoTube will conduct analyses and 
  calculate fold changes for A vs. C and B vs. C.</p>
  
  <h2>Gene Set Database</h2>
  <p>Required only for Gene Set Analysis feature. Gene set database (gmt format, such as those found at MSigDB)
  can be loaded here. An rds file could also be loaded, containing the gene set database in list form (each member of the 
  list is a vector of genes from one gene set). Alternatively, the REACTOME database can automattically be used without inputting 
  any database file, by clicking the checkbox below the Gene set database input.</p>

  <h2>Advanced Options</h2>
  <h3>Normalization Method</h3>
  <p>The Shiny app allows normalization using either the standard "nSolver" method,
  which conducts scaling normalization using positive control and housekeeping genes; or
  with the "RUVg" method (Risso et al., 2014), which Removes Unwanted Variation 
  based on housekeeping genes.</p>
  
  <h3>Housekeeping Genes</h3>
  <p>NanoTube will automatically identify housekeeping genes for normalization by selecting
  those marked as "Housekeeping" in the <b>CodeClass</b>. Alternatively, these can be manually
  specified with this option, by inputting a comma-separated list of genes to be used as housekeeping genes.</p>
  
  <h3>Negative Control Threshold</h3>
  <p>This step can be applied with any normalization method. The NanoTube app performs a two-sample, one-sided t test for each gene: this test compares the
  expression of that gene across all samples vs. the expression of all negative control genes
  across all samples. The p-value of this test is for the null hypothesis that the endogenous gene does
  not have expression above the negative control genes. In this field, you can specify the signifance
  level required to keep a gene for analysis. A lower value is a more stringent threshold: 
  genes with a p-value above this level will be removed, and not
  included in differential expression or gene set analysis. To skip this step, this value can be set to 2.</p>
  
  <h3>Number of Unwanted Factors</h3>
  <p>User can specify the number of unwanted factors to remove from the data (for RUV 
  normalization methods only). 1 is usually a good first guess, but it may need to
  be increased if variation based on batch/unwanted effects remains.</p>
  
  <h3>Number of Singular Values to drop</h3>
  <p>The number of signular values to drop when estimating unwanted variation factors (RUVg
  normalization only). 0 is a good first guess for this one, but it could be set to 1
  if the first singular value captures the effect of interest, for example. This number 
  must be less than the number of unwanted factors.</p>
  
  <h3>Minimum Gene Set Size</h3>
  <p>In this field, you can set the number of genes required for an individual gene set (from a loaded gmt file)
  to be included in analysis. For example, if this value is set to 5 (default), only gene sets with at least 5 genes present
  in your data set will be included in gene set analysis.</p>
