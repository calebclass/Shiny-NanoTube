  <h2>Positive Controls</h2>
  <p>The NanoTube web app identifies positive control, negative control, and housekeeping genes prior to analysis,
  mainly based on each gene's <b>CodeClass</b> in the input data.  Positive control normalization is performed by
  scaling all genes by 
  the <b>Scale Factor</b> for each sample, calculated using the geometric mean of the positive control genes. 
  Scale factors outside of the range 0.3-3 indicate high variance between samples and potential problems in the 
  data, and these should be checked before proceeding.</p>
  
  <p>A scatter plot of Observed vs. Expected expression of positive control genes is also provided
  for each sample, with the <b>R-squared</b> values provided in the table. "Expected" expression is
  identified from the positive control gene names. Low R-squared values potentially indicate issues in detection of
  the positive control genes.</p>
  
  <h2>Negative Controls</h2>
  <p>The <b>Endogenous Targets vs. Negative Controls</b> table shows how many of the endogenous genes "passed" the 
  comparison with negative control gene expression (defined in the <i>Setup</i> section). Genes that did not pass
  are removed, and not included in the analyses. The comparison statistics of each gene against the negative controls 
  are presented in the <b>Target Statistics</b> table.</p>
  
  <p>A table showing <b>Sample Statistics</b> for the detection of negative control genes within each sample is also provided, including 
  the average, maximum, and standard deviation of negative control gene detection. In addition, a threshold 
  "Background" level is  provided, and calculated using negative control gene expression as <i>cutoff = mean + 2*sd</i>. 
  The number (and percentage) of endogenous genes with 
  average expression below that level is presented for each sample. Samples with a high percentage of genes detected below
  background level may present a quality concern.</p>
  
  <p>Finally, a scatter chart of the detected counts of each negative control in each sample is also provided.</p>

  
  <h2>Housekeeping</h2>
  <p>As with positive control genes, a scale factor is calculated using the geometric mean of the 
  housekeeping genes for each sample, and this is used to normalize the endogenous genes. Housekeeping
  genes are automatically detected from RCC files, or they can be manually entered in the Advanced Options
  on the "Job Setup" tab. Scale factors outside the range of 0.3-3 indicate high variance between samples, and
  should be checked before proceeding.</p>
  
  <p>Boxplots of endogenous gene expression before and after normalization are also provided in this tab.</p>
