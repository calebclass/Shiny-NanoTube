  <h2>PCA</h2>
  <p>A simple Principal Components Analysis is performed using the 'prcomp' function, and 
  a scatterplot of the first two principal components is drawn here. Samples are represented as points,
  colored by their Group membership, and specific sample names can be identified by hovering over the points.</p>
  
  <h2>Volcano Plot</h2>
  <p>A volcano plot of the selected group vs. the base group is drawn here. Alternatively, if DE analysis was conducted 
  using a design matrix, you can select a design factor for the volcano plot. Fold change is calculated as FC =
  (Selected Group / Base Group), so genes on the right of the plot have higher expression in the Selected Group. 
  A log2(FC) and nominal p-value cutoff can be defined in the boxes, to draw vertical and horizontal lines (respectively)
  on the plot. Target names (such as gene symbols) can be identified by hovering over the points.</p>
  
  <h2>Differential Expression</h2>
  <p>For each analysis of Group vs. Base Group (indicated in parentheses), a table containing the following four
  columns is provided:</p>
  <p><b>Log2FC</b>: The log2 fold change of each gene, calculated as log2(Group / Base Group). Genes with positive 
  log2FC have higher expression in "Group", while those with negative log2FC have higher expression in "Base Group".</p>
  <p><b>t</b>: The comparison statistic calculated by 'limma'.</p>
  <p><b>p-val</b>: The nominal p-value calculated by 'limma'.</p>
  <p><b>q-val</b>: The p-value adjusted for multiple testing, using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.</p>
